    abstract = {PageRank is a commonly used measurement in a wide range of applications, including search engines, recommendation systems, and social networks. However, this measurement suffers from huge computational overhead, which cannot be scaled to large graphs. Although many approximate algorithms have been proposed for computing PageRank values, these algorithms are either (i) not efficient or (ii) not accurate. Worse still, some of them cannot provide estimated PageRank values for all the vertices. In this paper, we first propose the CUR-Trans algorithm, which can reduce the time complexity for computing PageRank values and has lower error bound than existing matrix approximation-based PageRank algorithms. Then, we develop the T 2-Approx algorithm to further reduce the time complexity for computing this measurement. Experiment results on three large-scale graphs show that both the CUR-Trans algorithm and the T 2-Approx algorithm achieve the lowest response time for computing PageRank values with the best accuracy (for the CUR-Trans algorithm) or the competitive accuracy (for the T 2-Approx algorithm). Besides, the two proposed algorithms are able to provide estimated PageRank values for all the vertices.},

    abstract = {From social networks to language modeling, the growing scale and importance of graph data has driven the development of numerous new graph-parallel systems (e.g., Pregel, GraphLab). By restricting the computation that can be expressed and introducing new techniques to partition and distribute the graph, these systems can efficiently execute iterative graph algorithms orders of magnitude faster than more general data-parallel systems. However, the same restrictions that enable the performance gains also make it difficult to express many of the important stages in a typical graph-analytics pipeline: constructing the graph, modifying its structure, or expressing computation that spans multiple graphs. As a consequence, existing graph analytics pipelines compose graph-parallel and data-parallel systems using external storage systems, leading to extensive data movement and complicated programming model. To address these challenges we introduce GraphX, a distributed graph computation framework that unifies graph-parallel and data-parallel computation. GraphX provides a small, core set of graph-parallel operators expressive enough to implement the Pregel and PowerGraph abstractions, yet simple enough to be cast in relational algebra. GraphX uses a collection of query optimization techniques such as automatic join rewrites to efficiently implement these graph-parallel operators. We evaluate GraphX on real-world graphs and workloads and demonstrate that GraphX achieves comparable performance as specialized graph computation systems, while outperforming them in end-to-end graph pipelines. Moreover, GraphX achieves a balance between expressiveness, performance, and ease of use.},

    abstract = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.},
